## Key Features

- **Doctor's Side**: Doctors can publish articles, share health tips, and provide medical advice.
- **Patient's Side**: Patients can follow doctors, engage with content (like, comment, share), and save important articles.
- **AI Integration**: The platform uses AI to provide personalized recommendations and automated responses to patient inquiries, enhancing the user experience.

## AI-Driven Benefits

- **Automated Responses**: AI assists in responding to patient inquiries quickly and efficiently through a **chat box**, providing useful information and guidance in real-time.
- **Improved Communication**: AI enhances the communication between doctors and patients, enabling more effective management of health-related information.

This AI-driven system helps both patients and doctors manage health-related information more effectively, improving patient care and fostering continuous engagement and communication.
 
## Technical Overview

### iOS Native Application

The application is developed using **iOS Native** technologies, providing a seamless experience on iPhones and iPads. The user interface is built using **SwiftUI**, Apple's modern framework for creating responsive and visually appealing user interfaces. SwiftUI allows us to create a declarative and dynamic UI, enhancing performance and usability.

- **SwiftUI**: Utilized for building the front-end of the app, ensuring a smooth and responsive interface.

### Architecture

The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture to separate the data, business logic, and UI. This design pattern promotes maintainability, testability, and scalability.

- **Model**: Represents the data structure and business logic.
- **View**: The visual interface that presents data to the user.
- **ViewModel**: Connects the Model and View, handling business logic and transforming data to make it viewable.

### Backend Development

The backend of the application is developed using **PHP Laravel**, a robust PHP framework that facilitates secure, scalable, and maintainable backend services. 

- **PHP Laravel**: Used to create RESTful APIs, handle authentication, data management, and provide endpoints for communication between the app and the backend.
- **Local Server**: The application uses a local server for testing and development, which ensures the app's functionality and backend interactions before deploying to production.

### AI Integration

Artificial Intelligence is integrated into the app to provide intelligent recommendations and responses to user interactions.

- **Local AI Model**: A custom-trained AI model is used locally to analyze patient data and provide personalized health advice and recommendations.
- **Llama API**: The app also leverages the **Llama API** for advanced AI capabilities, including automated responses to patient inquiries through the chat box and AI-assisted content recommendations.

### Data Storage

All user and app data is securely stored using **MySQL**, a relational database management system. The database handles all aspects of data persistence, including user profiles, health tips, articles, and interactions.

- **MySQL**: Used for storing user data, articles, comments, and other relevant health information.
  
### Data Management and Integration

To manage the data flow between the mobile application and backend, we utilize **REST APIs**. These APIs are responsible for sending and receiving data from the backend, ensuring the application functions efficiently and provides a smooth user experience.

- **REST APIs**: Facilitate communication between the iOS app and backend server, handling data requests, authentication, and updates in real-time.

### UI/UX Design

A complete **UI/UX** design was developed for the application to ensure an intuitive, user-friendly experience. The design focuses on usability, accessibility, and visual appeal, making the platform easy to navigate for both patients and doctors.

- **UI/UX Design**: Fully designed to cater to user needs, with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and efficiency in accessing medical information and interacting with the content.
