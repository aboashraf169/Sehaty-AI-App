# Sahaty AI
# AI-Powered Interactive Platform for Doctors and Patients

An advanced AI-powered interactive platform designed to bridge the gap between doctors and patients. The platform enables doctors to publish valuable articles, health tips, and medical advice, while allowing patients to follow their preferred doctors, interact with the content through likes, comments, and shares, and save important articles for future reference.

## Key Features

- **Doctor's Side**: Doctors can publish articles, share health tips, and provide medical advice.
- **Patient's Side**: Patients can follow doctors, engage with content (like, comment, share), and save important articles.
- **AI Integration**: The platform uses AI to provide personalized recommendations and automated responses to patient inquiries, enhancing the user experience.

## AI-Driven Benefits

- **Automated Responses**: AI assists in responding to patient inquiries quickly and efficiently through a **chat box**, providing useful information and guidance in real-time.
- **Improved Communication**: AI enhances the communication between doctors and patients, enabling more effective management of health-related information.

This AI-driven system helps both patients and doctors manage health-related information more effectively, improving patient care and fostering continuous engagement and communication.
 
## Technical Overview

### iOS Native Application

The application is developed using **iOS Native** technologies, providing a seamless experience on iPhones and iPads. The user interface is built using **SwiftUI**, Apple's modern framework for creating responsive and visually appealing user interfaces. SwiftUI allows us to create a declarative and dynamic UI, enhancing performance and usability.

- **SwiftUI**: Utilized for building the front-end of the app, ensuring a smooth and responsive interface.

### Architecture

The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture to separate the data, business logic, and UI. This design pattern promotes maintainability, testability, and scalability.

- **Model**: Represents the data structure and business logic.
- **View**: The visual interface that presents data to the user.
- **ViewModel**: Connects the Model and View, handling business logic and transforming data to make it viewable.

### Backend Development

The backend of the application is developed using **PHP Laravel**, a robust PHP framework that facilitates secure, scalable, and maintainable backend services. 

- **PHP Laravel**: Used to create RESTful APIs, handle authentication, data management, and provide endpoints for communication between the app and the backend.
- **Local Server**: The application uses a local server for testing and development, which ensures the app's functionality and backend interactions before deploying to production.

### AI Integration

Artificial Intelligence is integrated into the app to provide intelligent recommendations and responses to user interactions.

- **Local AI Model**: A custom-trained AI model is used locally to analyze patient data and provide personalized health advice and recommendations.
- **Llama API**: The app also leverages the **Llama API** for advanced AI capabilities, including automated responses to patient inquiries through the chat box and AI-assisted content recommendations.

### Data Storage

All user and app data is securely stored using **MySQL**, a relational database management system. The database handles all aspects of data persistence, including user profiles, health tips, articles, and interactions.

- **MySQL**: Used for storing user data, articles, comments, and other relevant health information.
  
### Data Management and Integration

To manage the data flow between the mobile application and backend, we utilize **REST APIs**. These APIs are responsible for sending and receiving data from the backend, ensuring the application functions efficiently and provides a smooth user experience.

- **REST APIs**: Facilitate communication between the iOS app and backend server, handling data requests, authentication, and updates in real-time.

### UI/UX Design

A complete **UI/UX** design was developed for the application to ensure an intuitive, user-friendly experience. The design focuses on usability, accessibility, and visual appeal, making the platform easy to navigate for both patients and doctors.

- **UI/UX Design**: Fully designed to cater to user needs, with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and efficiency in accessing medical information and interacting with the content.
